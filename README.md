Description.

The Server Configuration and Management Automation project aims to implement a comprehensive automation solution that efficiently handles the configuration, administration, and deployment of servers. This initiative leverages modern DevOps technologies, including Ansible for task automation, Terraform for infrastructure as code, across both Linux (Ubuntu/CentOS) and Windows Server environments.

Structure.

The project is structured into three phases: Planning and Design, Implementation, and Monitoring and Optimization. With a focus on scalability and efficiency, the project seeks to minimize manual intervention in server management tasks, optimize deployment times, and enhance the overall reliability of IT infrastructure.
